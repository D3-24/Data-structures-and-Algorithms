### Description

The Data Structures and Algorithms Library is an open-source collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms, designed to be language-agnostic. Whether you're working in C++, Python, Java, or any other programming language, this library aims to provide a comprehensive set of solutions for common data structure and algorithm problems. From fundamental data structures like arrays and linked lists to advanced algorithms like sorting and graph traversal, our goal is to create a collaborative resource that benefits developers of all backgrounds.

### Key Features

* **Implementation in multiple programming languages:** Contributions are welcome in any programming language, making the library accessible to a wide range of developers.
* **Comprehensive coverage:** Includes implementations for fundamental data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms).
* **Well-documented code:** Each implementation is accompanied by clear explanations and documentation to aid understanding and usage.
* **Community-driven:** We encourage contributions from developers of all skill levels and backgrounds to help improve and expand the library.
